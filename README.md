# MathsQuiz

Small Maths quiz app to generate questions for my 8 and 2 year old.

Very much a work in progress as I start playing around with C++.

As a newbie to C++ I don't know how I should be setting up the project, what compiler I should be using or any of the other stuff, if you have any best practice suggestions please leave a comment in an issue.
